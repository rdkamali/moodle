Information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 4.1 ===

* New external method `core_reportbuilder_set_filters` for setting report filter values (plus `setFilters` AJAX repository
  export for calling from Javascript modules)
* New method `set_filter_form_default` in base system report class, to override whether the default filters form
  should be shown for a report
* The external `core_reportbuilder_filters_reset` method now accepts an optional `parameters` argument, required by
  some system reports
* New external methods for retrieving custom report data:
  - `core_reportbuilder_view_report`
* 'set_default_per_page' and 'get_default_per_page' methods have been added to \local\report\base class
  to manage the default displayed rows per page.
* Added two new methods in the datasource class:
  - add_all_from_entity() to add all columns/filters/conditions from the given entity to the report at once
  - add_all_from_entities() to add all columns/filters/conditions from all the entities added to the report at once
* New database helper methods for generating multiple unique values: `generate_aliases` and `generate_param_names`
* The base aggregation `format_value` method has a `$columntype` argument in order to preserve type during aggregation. When
  defining column callbacks, strict typing will now be preserved in your callback methods when the column is being aggregated
* The method `get_joins()` in the base entity class is now public, allowing for easier joins within reports
* The following local helper methods have been deprecated, their implementation moved to exporters:
  - `audience::get_all_audiences_menu_types` -> `custom_report_audience_cards_exporter`
  - `report::get_available_columns` -> `custom_report_column_cards_exporter`
* The following permission methods now accept an optional `$context` parameter (default system context):
  - `[require_]can_view_reports_list`
  - `[require_]can_create_report`
* New method `get_default_condition_values()` in base datasource class, to be overridden by sources that wish to
  define default values for conditions upon report creation.
* New report filter types:
  - `category` for reports containing course categories
  - `tags` for reports containing entities with support for core_tag API
  - `autocomplete` for reports that contain pre-defined values for selection.
* The helper method `get_custom_report_content()` now accepts a list of filters and applies them to the report
